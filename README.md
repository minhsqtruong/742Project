# 742Project
<p>This repository contains simulation infrastructure and results related to our study on PIM and HMC for Sparse Graph Workloads.
<p>The most up to date files are reflected in McKenzie's branch. There you will find a folder for changes made to the Gem5 simulator (gem5_changes) as well as a results folder for the various test that were run (results/gem5/X86). The microbenchmark binaries can be generated from microbench.cpp and feed to gem5. The benchmark result is in results/microbench. The ramulator-pim results are located at results/ramulatorpim
